# Project Start Guide

> Make sure to run the command that will install the dependencies

```sh
$ npm install
```

### Before you can run the project make sure `mongoDB database` is up and running and the `week6 demo`

Now we can start the server with the following command to begin development

```sh
$ npm start
```

All changes made in `app_client` will picked up and update the `spa.min.js` file.

> Run `spa.html` as it's own page
